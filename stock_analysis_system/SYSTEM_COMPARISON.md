### DeFi Features
```python
# Static protocol characteristics
'tvlUsd', 'volumeUsd1d', 'project', 'chain', 'symbol'
'apy_efficiency', 'risk_score', 'stability_score'
```

### Stock Features  
```python

'volatility_score', 'momentum_indicators'
```

## 🔄 **Temporal Considerations**

### DeFi Analysis
- **Nature**: Snapshot analysis of current protocol state
- **Validation**: Cross-sectional (protocol-wise splits)
- **Prediction**: Current yield sustainability
- **Rebalancing**: Monthly/quarterly based on TVL changes

### Stock Analysis
- **Nature**: Time series forecasting
- **Validation**: Temporal splits (past predicts future)
- **Prediction**: Next-period price movements
- **Rebalancing**: Daily/weekly based on signals

## 📊 **Output Adaptations**

### Visualization Changes
| Plot Type | DeFi Focus | Stock Focus |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Data Overview** | APY vs TVL scatter | Returns vs Price scatter |
| **Performance** | Model MAPE comparison | Model RMSE + Directional Accuracy |
| **Segmentation** | Stablecoin allocation | Sector allocation |
| **Risk-Return** | Protocol risk ranking | Stock risk-return by sector |

### Report Changes
| Report | DeFi Content | Stock Content |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Recommendations** | Protocol selection by type | Stock selection by sector |
| **Strategy Summary** | Stablecoin allocation % | Sector allocation strategy |
| **Executive Summary** | APY projections | Return/volatility projections |

## 🚀 **Usage Scenarios**

### DeFi Analysis System
```bash
# Yield farming optimization
python run_defi_analysis.py --investment-amount 1000000
# Expected: 8-11% APY recommendations
```

### Stock Analysis System  
```bash
# Stock portfolio optimization
python run_stock_analysis.py --investment-amount 1000000
# Expected: 10-16% annual return with sector diversification
```

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### Speed Enhancements in Stock Analysis System
The Stock Analysis System includes several performance optimizations not present in the DeFi system:

#### **Quick Mode (`--quick-mode`)**
```bash
# Fast training for development/testing
python run_stock_analysis.py --tree-models-only --quick-mode
```

| Optimization | Regular Mode | Quick Mode | Speedup |
|-------------|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Random Forest** | 200 trees | 20-100 trees | ~5-10x faster |
| **XGBoost/LightGBM** | 200 trees | 50 trees | ~4x faster |
| **Cross-Validation** | 5-fold | 3-fold | ~1.7x faster |
| **Data Sampling** | Full dataset | 50K samples | ~2-20x faster |
| **Visualizations** | All plots | Skip heavy plots | ~3x faster |

#### **GPU Acceleration Support**
- **XGBoost**: `tree_method='gpu_hist'` for CUDA acceleration
- **LightGBM**: `device='gpu'` for OpenCL acceleration  
- **CatBoost**: `task_type='GPU'` for CUDA acceleration
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to optimized CPU algorithms if GPU unavailable

#### **Model Prioritization**
1. **LightGBM** - Fastest model, trained first
2. **Random Forest** - Optimized with reduced complexity
3. **XGBoost** - GPU-accelerated when available
4. **CatBoost** - Skipped in quick mode for speed

#### **Memory Optimizations**
- **Data Sampling**: Automatic sampling for datasets >50K records
- **Feature Selection**: `max_features='sqrt'` in quick mode
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for wide datasets with `force_row_wise=True`

### Performance Comparison

| System | Training Time | Model Count | GPU Support | Quick Mode |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **DeFi Analysis** | ~60-120s | 4 models | No | No |
| **Stock Analysis (Regular)** | ~120-300s | 4 models | Yes | No |
| **Stock Analysis (Quick)** | ~30-60s | 2-3 models | Yes | Yes |

### Scalability Improvements

#### **Dataset Size Handling**
- **DeFi**: 52 protocols (small, static)
- **Stock**: 1M+ records (large, time series)
- **Auto-sampling**: Reduces large datasets for development
- **Memory efficient**: Optimized for financial time series

#### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Development cycle
python run_stock_analysis.py --quick-mode          # Fast iteration
python run_stock_analysis.py --tree-models-only    # Full model comparison  
python run_stock_analysis.py --full-analysis       # Production run
```

This comparison demonstrates how the Stock Analysis System has been optimized for both speed and scalability while maintaining the professional quality of the DeFi system.
